Description: BC5 and the Dos Power Pack

Let me start by saying, officially, The PowerPack for DOS was
designed for Borland C++ 4.02 and 4.5x.  It WILL NOT work with
Borland C++ 5.0. Again, it WILL NOT work with Borland C++ 5.0
Everything in this document is COMPLETELY UNSUPPORTED.  Do NOT
call technical support regarding these issues, as they are
obligated to tell you they don't work.

That said, here are some steps to guide you in your attempt to
use the PowerPack with BC5.

1.  Installation

Installation of the PowerPack under BC++ 5.0 has not changed.

Here is a list of the modified (added) files:

C:\WINDOWS
  BCW     .INI
  BORHELP .INI
  WINHELP .INI

D:\BC50
  PFILELST.TXT
  PINSTALL.TXT
  README
  README  .TXT
  UNPAK   .EXE

D:\BC50\BIN
  32RTM   .EXE
  SVGA32  .DLL

The following directories and their contents have been added by
the PowerPack installation:

\BC50\EXAMPLES\DPMI
\BC50\EXAMPLES\DPMI16
\BC50\EXAMPLES\DPMI32
\BC50\EXAMPLES\TVISION
\BC50\INCLUDE\TVISION
\BC50\LIB\TVISION
\BC50\SOURCE\TVISION

2.  Use of the PowerPack and BC5

The PowerPack targets (DPMI16 & DPMI32) can no longer be used
from the IDE.  In order to create protected mode DOS
applications, you must use the command-line tools.  You will
probably want to create makefiles from 4.02/4.5x project files
and use those with BC5.

The usage of the command-line tools to create DPMI apps has
not changed.  For DPMI16, you use: bcc -WX -ml, and for DPMI32
use bcc32 -WX.

5.  CodeGuard and DPMI

Let me start, again, by saying CodeGuard 16 is a Windows-16 only
debugging tool.  Officially, it WILL NOT work with 16 bit DPMI
apps. However, in most cases it does seem to work.

To use CodeGuard16, on the command-line, just add CG16.LIB to
your TLINK or BCC line:

   bcc -WX -ml myapp.cpp mystuff.cpp mylib.lib cg16.lib
