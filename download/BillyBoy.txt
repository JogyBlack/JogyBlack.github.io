                              Billy Boy Won't Get My Coin
                              ===========================

                              Microsoft and Billy Boy
                              Keep on selling us their toys:
                              Windoze, MessyDos and Word,
                              Excel, Office and that Works...
                              Did I say it really works?
                              Sure, it may work great for Bill,
                              Stacking money on the hill,
                              Being on the top until
                              Someone other climbs the hill.
                              So the bottom line is: nil!

                              People from United States,
                              Why do you support Bill Gates?
                              Don't you think Win Ninety-five
                              Will enslave you for a life?

                              Please don't let Monsieur Bill Gates
                              And his user interface
                              Move you in the wrong direction --
                              Windows General Protection
                              Faults will torture you forever,
                              And especially whenever
                              You're about to save your work!
                              Did we came up to the fork?

                              And the fork is this: you may
                              Either stick to Billy Gates,
                              Or just go another way --
                              Save your trouble, don't you pay
                              So much money, don't you stay
                              On the bandwagon with Bill!
                              Join the GNU Project! It will
                              Change your mind and point of view.
                              Richard Stalman and his crew,
                              Linus Torvalds and his Linux
                              Point the way to go between us.

                              Grab the Linux and enjoy!
                              (It's a Unix, not a toy!)
                              And forget that Billy Boy!
