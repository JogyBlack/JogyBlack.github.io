Tools55: Free Compiler and Linker Tools IDE Integration AddOn
================================================================================

This toolset is based on the exaddon.ide project from:
$env(BCROOT)\EXAMPLES\IDE\ADDON\TESTBED (BCROOT is C:\BORLAND\BC5 on my machine)

The objective to write this AddOn was a mail from Jogy, complaining about the
hard way to find a normal tool commandline string to let the Free 5.5 tools
work. Also his, Kalin's and my problem is, that the way described give poor
integration in the IDE 5.02.

With creating this AddOn I think I can accomplish total and tight integration,
as well as complete MPD settings (Option Pages) transfer for every project
node's settings.

To use this AddOn read....(please)

Getting Started
---------------
Note: the Copy and Register steps are automatically performed by the instalation.

- Copy -
Copy Tools55.dll to your $env(BCROOT)\bin directory

- Registering your dll at install time -
Add your addon dll key in the registry under the following key:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
 SOFTWARE
  Borland
    Borland C++
     5.0
      IDE
	AddOns
	 Tools55

Key: "Tools55"
  Value: "Path"     Data: "c:\bc5\bin\tools55.dll"
  Value: "Enabled"  Data: "Yes"


- During development -,
you can use addonreg.exe to quickly add, delete, enable and disable addon
registry entries (or to see exactly what the entry should look like).

- After setup -
Create an evironment variable BC55ROOT to point to the location of
the 5.5 executables. This variable will be used by Tools 5.5 by default.

Look at the tools menu, there are 6 Brand-New 5.5 Tools appearing
Then check them out by selecting Options|Project, Options|Environment or
right-click a node and select Edit Local Options


History:
================================================================================
Version 1.0.0	03/03/2000

	correct -o option)
	Added Preferences page to Environment|Tools 5.5, now includes default
	usage of 5.5. tools, including swapping of all the nodes in the project
	Added preliminary linker version, no options yet, other than

	Linker also recognizes AppExpert as an .exe

Version 1.0.8   03/14/2000
	Added Library pages
	Added Resource pages (not functional)
	Implemented Librarian

Version 1.0.9   03/15/2000
	Added Device Driver option to Linker page
	Added __msfastcall to compiler calling conventions
	Added Microsoft Visual C++ compatibility
	Added old-style Borland C++ structure layout
	Re-enabled Template generation options
	Added "dirty-editor" checker to RC and C/C++ compiler
	Added preliminary autodependency generator

Version 1.0.10  03/16/2000
	Added autodepchecker which reads from the .obj files just
	compiled
	Added "Abort" capability by pressing "Cancel"
	Basically completed the project for first release.

Version 1.0.11  03/18/2000
	Added About page including credits.
	Re-engineered the toolswitching algorithm between standard and 5.5 tools
	Modified the link and lib dependency checker, to also include nested
	targets, runtime-nodes without extension and sourcepools.
	Added "5.5 LinkLibrary" tool to support the above. (sets -Gi option on
	linker always automatically, and converts OutputLocation to .dll/.exe
	instead of .lib)
	Cleaned-up sources, headers to make full use of pch's

Version 1.0.12  03/19/2000
	Added preliminary and experimental TargetExpert page (does nothing)

Version 1.0.13  03/20/2000
	Fixed problem with "textlimit" in BRC32.exe field
	Completed classes for Target Expert pages, settings are save,
	node addition and deletion still has to be done.

Version 1.0.14  04/02/2000
	Changed autodependency checker for .rc's
	Changed Auto tool conversion to 5.5 to work only on Win32 targets,
	except when explicitly a 5.5 target has been created.
	Changed startup tool registering, now without tool conversion. This only
	happens now when modified in Preferences page after user presses OK
	Finally got Target Expert to work a bit, still needs property settings
	back in the project's nodes (like Image model, debugging etc.)

Version 1.0.15  04/02/2000
	Added -tW,-tWD, -tWC, -tWM to the compiler options to control the
	built-in predefined macro's: __DLL__ __MT__ and __CONSOLE__
	Options are taken from either the TargetServer or TX_xxx55_MODEL and
	TX_xxx55_MT properties of one of the Tools 55 targets (xxx is either APP
	or DLL). Todo: have to respect TX's settings about the model
	(GUI/Console) when linking, now still has to be set at the
	Linker's option page.

Version 1.0.16  04/04/2000
	Fixed some problems with "original" Target Expert targets, keeping
	history after being converted to 5.5 targets
	Added code to prefix Options|project|directories|Source during
	compilation

Version 1.1.0  04/11/2000
	Second Release version. This version has some known caveats:
	1) Although the "Source Directory" from Options|Project|Directories is
	obeyed by the compiler's and the linker, It may occur that the IDE it
	self cannot find the source by double clicking in the project tree.
	2) The compiler hase some problems finding-out to whether or not create
	a multitrhreaded .obj. Due to this fact I advise to change the
	"Original" target to a 5.5 counterpart.
	3) There are no provisions yet to create .lib's with an appropriate
	5.5 Target.
	4) After adding a node to a target, one still has to change manually to
	a 5.5 translator. This also happens when changing from original to 5.5
	targets. Prefered way of working:
	- Open original project,
	- Check Options|Environment|Preferences|Use as Default,
	- press OK (All translators will be changed)
	- Change the target to a 5.5 target
	- Optionally UN-check the option mentioned above, the automatic transfer
	  will not have effects anymore on 5.5 targets
	5) When changing .dll targets to 5.5 .dll target, it's translator is
	changed to <5.5 LinkTarget> UNCONDITIONALLY. If you had <LinkLibrary>
	before, please change it by hand to <5.5 LinkLibrary>, otherwise no
	importlib will be created.

	Althoug the above may be enough reason to not use this version of
	Tools 5.5, I think it's a major improvement on the original release.

Version 1.1.1  05/20/2000
	On request of "bullock@mrcmry.com" (Greg) made error messages split
	across more than one line to prevent :
	!! Internal IDE Error: <Message formatting has failed for this message>

Version 1.1.2  07/03/2000
	Modified by Greg Bullock to partly emulate the IDE's internal compiler's
	treatment of white space in the Options:Compiler:Defines.
	With previous versions of the command line compiler, and I'm assuming
	this is true for 5.5 as well, the defines for the C++Compiler and the
	ResourceCompiler couldn't have white space.  But the
	Options:Compiler:Defines dialog allows the user to enter white space.
	Moreover, with the IDE compiler, carriage return/line feed combinations
	are legal and interpreted to be semicolons. This partly emulates that
	behavior by replacing initial white space characters with ';' and removing
	any adjacent white space.

Version 1.1.3  07/07/2000
	Modified by Greg Bullock to emulate the IDE's internal compiler's
	treatment of the source path.  Tools55 now permits the source path to
	be a "search" path, with multiple directories delimited by ';'.

Version 1.1.4  07/08/2000
	Re-combined Greg's changes into this version, changed About's
	Credits-Box to scrollable edit control.

Version 1.1.5  03/13/2001
        Incorporated Leo Sutic's fix of an exception which occurs when 
        creating New Project and selecting 5.5 exe or dll target.
	Changed the default paths to "$env(BC55ROOT)\bin\*"
	Fixed by Jogy a problem that targets with staticaly linked libraries
	are compiled always with multithreading regardless of the target settings.

Version 1.1.6  03/13/2001
	Added CodeGuard support in the options pages. It requires CG32.DLL and CG32.LIB
	from C++ Builder 5. The library and DLL from Borland C++ 5.x won't work!
	To turn on CodeGuard for a target it must be checked in the Target Expert options
	(either 5.5 or the standard), and also in the Compiler Options in the page for 
	CodeGuard all options must be checked. To remove CodeGuard, all of these must
	be manualy unchecked. This will be automated in the next version. 

Version 1.1.7  01/17/2002
	Fixed a bit the Compiler Options CodeGuard page - now when CG is turned off, 
	the three other options are grayed, and don't have to be turned off manually,
	like in the first version.

Version 1.1.8  05/29/2002
        In Options/Environment/Tools 5.5 added new field, which allows to specify additional 
        options to bcc32.exe

Version 1.1.9  06/24/2002
        Fixed a minor bug in Tools 5.5 Environment Options - they used the environment 
        variable BC55ROOT, but the instalation sets the variable BCC55ROOT.


Have fun,

Karst.
