replayed that commercial programs cannot be developed with the free compiler.

accomplish this. Check http://michael.tippach.bei.t-online.de/wdosx/

Q: Why functions inport()/outport() are not found in BCC5.5?
A: These functions access ports directly, which is not permitted under 32-bit Windows.
Use Windows API function for communication with hardware.

Q: I cannot find the header file graphics.h!
A: This file is used for the BGI (Borland Graphics Interface) functions for graphics under DOS.
They cannot be used from 32-bit Windows programs, use Windows GDI functions instead.
There is an emulation for GDI, called WinGDI, but is not tested with BCC 5.5. Check http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~main/bgi/
