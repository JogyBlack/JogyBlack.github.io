<BR><BR><BR>
<P align=left>In 1996, together with Kiril Simov and 
<A HREF="htttp://www.sirma.bg/ak.htm" TARGET="_blank">Atanas Kiryakov</A>, I began working on
a Bulgarian language morphology project. Recently  this project became part of 
<A HREF="http://www.ontotext.com/" TARGET="_blank">OntoText Lab</A>.</P>
The software I created consists of two main programs - <B>Slovnik</B> - Windows GUI application
which can be used to browse the full dictionary, to search for words, and to perform various analyzes upon text files.</P>
The other is a server program which receiver words via TCP/IP sockets, and returns all forms of the given words.
This server works under both Windows and <A HREF="linux.html">Linux</A>.
