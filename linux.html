<P align=left>I have ported to Linux the server for the <A HREF="slovnik.html">Bulgarian language morphology</A> project.</P>
The porting to Linux was fairly easy due to the fact that I had used only standard library functions. A small issue was
the moving from case insensitive OS to case sensitive one.</P>
A very nice IDE that I used was <A HREF="http://www.tu-chemnitz.de/~sho/rho/rhide/rhide.html" TARGET="_blank">RHIDE</A>, 
which is similar to the old DOS Borland IDEs.</P>
<BR>
Recently I installed <A HREF="http://www.suse.com/" TARGET="_blank">Suse Linux 7.0 Professional</A>, 
and began to learn <A HREF="http://www.kde.org/" TARGET="_blank">KDE</A> programming with KDevelop.</P>
<BR>
Here is a small <A HREF="download/BillyBoy.txt">poem</A>, found somewhere on the web.</P>
