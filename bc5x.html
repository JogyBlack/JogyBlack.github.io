<P align=left>There is a bug in the exception handling routines in Borland C++ 5.02.
There were discussions about the problem in Borland newsgroups, some of them can be read here:

</ul>

Possible solutions to the problem are:

<ol>
<li>If the program experiences crashes, turn *off* the "Enable destructor cleanup" flag in the project options 
<li>Downgrade to Borland C++ 5.01, where the exception handling still worked.
<li>Upgrade to <a href="bcc55.html">Borland C++ 5.5</a>, where the problem should be fixed. 
    The <a href="addons.html">Add-On</a> Tools55 allows using BCC55 from BC5.02 IDE.
