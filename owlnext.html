<P align=left>After 
<A href="http://www.borland.com/" TARGET="_blank">Borland</A> dropped the support for the Borland C++/
<A HREF="owl.html">OWL</A> line, and aimed their efforts at 
<A href="http://www.inprise.com/bcppbuilder/" TARGET="_blank">C++ Builder</A>, 
Yura Bidus began development of <A href="http://www.owlnext.org/" TARGET="_blank">OWL Next</A>
 - a freeware upgrade to OWL5, which contains many bug fixes and new features.</P>
Also OWL Next can be used not only with Borland C++ 5, but with 
Visual C++ 5 and 6, with C++ Builder, with the free command-line compiler 
<A HREF="http://www.inprise.com/bcppbuilder/freecompiler/" TARGET="_blank">Borland C++ 5.5</A> and with gcc++.</P>
Greg Chicares has written a comprehensive instruction about installing and compiling OWLNext. It can be downloaded 
<A HREF="download/owl6inst.zip">here</A>. <b>NOTE: Updated version is now available at the OWLNext site.</b></P>

The drawback with OWL Next is that it is only an upgrade to OWL 5, 
so OWL 5 must be purchased before using OWLNext. It can be aquired from a supplier, which stocks 
discontinued software, by searching in <A HREF="http://www.ebay.com/" TARGET="_blank">ebay.com</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.recycledsoftware.com/" TARGET="_blank">Recycled Software</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.emsps.com/oldtools/borland.htm" TARGET="_blank">EMS Professional Software</A>,
or from the Companion CD which comes with Professional and Enterprise versions of 
<A href="http://www.inprise.com/bcppbuilder/" TARGET="_blank">C++ Builder</A>.</P>  

Yura had started talks with Borland about releasing the source of OWL, and starting an open-source project,
but so far the replies were that there are some legal issues, and it can't be done quickly.</P>

My co-worker, Boris Vidolov, wrote a tool for converting Borland C++ resource files to Visual C++ compatible
resource files. The difference is that in Borland .rc files the bitmaps can be contained in binary format
inside the file, whereas in Visual C++ they must be in separate files. The tool can be downloaded from
