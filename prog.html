    <TD>VRML PixelTexture Converter is a program for converting Windows bitmap file to a VRML PixelTexture node.<BR>
	    Another bitmap file may be specified as a transparency mask to be used in the texture.<BR>
		The texture can be converted to grayscale.<BR>
		The output format can be: 
		<UL>
			<LI>Plain Text - to use directly in a VRML file.</LI>
			<LI>C++ Source - to use as a string constant in a C/C++ program.</LI>
			<LI>VRML Box - to generate a simple VRML box using the resulting texture.</LI>

    <TD>SetFolderIcon is Windows GUI application for changing the icon of any folder.<BR>
		To set an icon for a folder:
		<OL>
			<LI>Click on the "Select Folder" button to select the folder which icon is to be changed.</LI>
			<LI>Click on the "Select File" button to select a file, containing icons. When the file is opened, the list of available icons will appear in the right-hand box.</LI>
			<LI>If you want a tooltip to be shown for the folder, enter the text in the "InfoTip" edit field.</LI>
			<LI>Select the desired icon and click the "Set Icon" button.</LI>
		</OL>
		To restore the default folder icon:
		<OL>
			<LI>Click on the "Select Folder" button to select the folder which icon is to be restored.</LI>
			<LI>Click on the "Clear Icon" button.</LI>
		</OL>
		This program is inspired by a post from Yoto Yotov in borland.public.cppbuilder.winapi, describing how to change the folder icons.<BR>
		Basicaly, the program writes a desktop.ini file, which contains the path to the icon file, and sets the system attribute of the folder.</P>

    <TD>In Windows 95 and later, when a CD is inserted in the CD-ROM, Windows checks
	for a file named <B>Autorun.inf</B> and if there is one, executes the application 
	specified in the entry <B>open</B> in the section <B>[AutoRun]</B>. With Internet 
	Explorer 5 was introduced the option to specify not only application, but any file,
	which extension is registered, to be started from <B>Autorun.inf</B>, when specified
	in the entry <B>ShellExecute</B>. To achieve the same functionality under previous
	versions of Internet Explorer, I have created a simple AutoRun application, which 
	opens the document specified in <B>Autorun.inf</B>.<BR>

    <TD>The default jump and popup colors in Windows Help are green. In my opinion green on white is not very 
	good combination. And there is no user interface for changing these colors.</P>
	I have created a small program to allow the user to easily change the help colors. 
	Under Windows 95/98 and NT/2000 the settings for help color are found in different places. 
	Under Windows 95/98 they are located in <B>WIN.INI</B>, in the section <B>[Windows Help]</B>, 
	entries <B>JumpColor</B> and <B>PopupColor</B>.
	They can be set for example to: JumpColor=0 0 255 and PopupColor=255 0 0.<BR>
	Under Windows NT and 2K the settings are in the registry, key 
	<B>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows Help</B>. The names and format of the entries are same as in 95/98.</P>

    The supported code pages are:

		<LI><B>D</B> - DOS, the cyrillic is located between ASCII 0x80 and ASCII 0xBF. It was used in most Bulgarian programs under MS-DOS.
	    <LI><B>R</B> - DOS russian, the cyrillic is located between ASCII 0x80 and ASCII 0xAF and another set between 0xE0 and 0xFF. 
	    It is rarely used, mostly in text files coming from Russia.
	    <LI><B>W</B> - Windows, the cyrillic is located between ASCII 0xC0 and ASCII 0xFF. It's the cyrillic code page used in MS-Windows applications.
	    <LI><B>L</B> - Latin, phonetic transcription of all cyrillic letters to corresponding letters from the latin aplhabet.
	    <LI><B>U</B> - Unicode (input only) -  double-byte character set, cyrillic is located at code page 0x0400.
    </UL></P>
	There is a simpler JavaScript <A HREF="conv.html">variant</A> which converts only Windows cyrillic to Latin.</P></TD>

    <TD>In Windows 95, NT 4.0 and older releases of 98 and 2000 the name for the day of the week for Thursday 
	in Bulgarian is misspelled. This mistake is not widely known, because by default, in Bulgarian regional settings, 
	the day of week is not shown in the date. To show it, start the Control Panel, open the Regional Options, 
	and in the Date page for Long date format enter the string <B>dddd,&nbsp;dd&nbsp;MMMM&nbsp;yyyy</B>.</P>
    I have created a small program in C++ Builder 5, which opens the file, corrects the name, 
	and then restarts Windows for the changes to take effect.</P>
	When the program is started, it shows a dialog. At the top appears the location of <B>locale.nls</B> 
	where the mistaken string is located. Below are the positions at which the misspelled text for Thursday 
	are found. If the file does not contain misspelled text, there will be written <I>(none found)</I> and the 
	button &quot;<B>Fix Now</B>&quot; will be disabled. The checkbox &quot;<B>Create backup file</B>&quot; is used to tell the program 
	to create a backup of <B>locale.nls</B> when fixing it. When a previously created backup file exists, 
	the button &quot;<B>Restore</B>&quot; is enabled, and allows you to restore the original <B>locale.nls</B>.
    When the file <B>locale.nls</B> is changed, the program asks if the system should be restarted now.</P>
    The strings in <B>locale.nls</B> are written in <I>UNICODE</I>. More information about <I>UNICODE</I> can be 
	found at <A HREF="www.unicode.org">www.unicode.org</A>. The misspelled string for Thursday in Bulgarian in 
	<I>UNICODE</I> is <B>0x47, 0x04, 0x35, 0x04, 0x42, 0x04, 0x32, 0x04, 0x4A, 0x04, 0x32, 0x04, 0x42, 0x04, 0x4A, 0x04, 0x3A, 0x04</B>
    and usualy is found at two places in the file. The second <B>0x32</B> must be changed to <B>0x40</B>.</P>
	The program copies <B>locale.nls</B> to <B>locale.tmp</B>, and changes the byte. After that it tells the 
	system to copy <B>locale.tmp</B> to <B>locale.nls</B> on next startup. Under Windows 95/98 and Windows NT/2000 
	this is done differently - under Windows 95/98 by writing to the <B>[rename]</B> section of <B>WININIT.INI</B>, 
	and under Windows NT/2000 by using the API function <B>MoveFileEx()</B>.</P></TD>
